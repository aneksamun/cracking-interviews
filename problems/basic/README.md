- [Frog.hs](Frog.hs) counts minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
For example having x = 10, y = 85 and d = 30, the result must be (85 - 10) / 30 = 7.5

Euler Problem 9:   
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2   
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.   
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.   
Find the product abc.
