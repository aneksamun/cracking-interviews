### <ins>Luhn algorithm</ins>

The Luhn algorithm is used to check bank card numbers for simple errors such as mistyping a digit, and proceeds as follows:
- consider each digit as a separate number;
- moving left, double the value of every second digit;
- if the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) to get a single digit number;
- add all these digits together;
- if the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulus 10 is congruent to 0), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula, else it is not valid.

```haskell
*Main> luhn4 1 7 8 4
True
*Main> luhn4 4 7 8 3
False
